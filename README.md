# js_vs_Es6_practice


### What I learned

1. I learned that coding is a lifestyle, you keep practicing, it become a hobby.

2. It's very humbling that even I finished full-stack development for 5 months now, i still think, I don't know everything. my honest review to myself.

3. keep improving! I'll get there someday.
